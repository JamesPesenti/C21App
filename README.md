I built this website using React Native Web with Expo Router. It features-

• File-based navigation bar 
• Screen to display the realtor's current homes for sale 
• Navigation to link the user to the IDX(Internet Data Exchange) on Century 21's website
• A section that displays past customer reviews

My friend asked me to build him a realtor website for him, and I agreed despite the fact that I was a little rusty with web development since I started primarily working with React Native. But after reading the docs I relized I could build a web app fully using RN for a seamless development experience!
